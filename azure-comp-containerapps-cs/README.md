- Azure Container App

## Demonstrated Capabilities
- "Single line" Pulumi program
- Remote Pulumi component(s) (`AppBuildDeploy`, `StackSettings`)

## Related Template(s)
- "azure-containerapps-*" can be used to show un-simplified examples that do the same thing but without reusable components.
- "azure-comp-containerapps-*" can be used to compare different language examples of the same program.

## Additional Note
- This project has a few different versions of the program that can be used to show different levels of abstraction.
